# Fixed-Order-Randomizer-Catch-Em-Call
Yes, the name sounds like an oxymoron. It'll make sense, I promise. The goal of this challenge is to offer a playthrough model that isnâ€™t just a Nuzlocke with more rules (although there are optional rules for those that enjoy that style of gameplay).  If only the most basic of rules are followed, this is less of a challenge and more a different way of playing the game.  I highly recommend utilizing one of the additional rule sets, which greatly increase the difficulty and variety encountered.

The challenge is currently designed for any of the mainline games in Generations 1 through 5.  
Additionally, the SpeedChoice ROMhacks are allowed for this challenge, but must not be configured to change plot or gameplay progression at all.

# Rules
The core challenge only has two rules:
1. Unobtained Pokemon can only be acquired in the order outlined in the Catch Order.
    1a. Duplicates of previously obtained Pokemon can be acquired freely.
2. The Final Boss(es) must not be challenged until the Pokedex is complete.

If either of the two rules above are broken, the game must be immediately restarted from the last save.  If a save is made following one of these rules being broken, the challenge is considered completely failed and must be started over entirely.

## Getting Started
### Catch Order
The Catch Order must be determined before starting gameplay, as the Catch Order also determines the starter Pokemon for you and your Rival.  

The Catch Order can be a pre-determined list (based on existing material such as the Pokedex or PokeRap) or created randomly.  Randomized Catch Orders can be generated here: https://pco.bobchao87.com

The first two Pokemon in the Catch Order represent your starting Pokemon and your Rival's starting Pokemon.  This ensures you have information on two pokemon that can be acquired following your first Rival battle.  The purpose of this is to allow for progression planning and to help identify undesireable seeds early.

#### Catch Order Rules
- Every Catch Order must contain each Pokemon that has a unique numbered entry in the given Generation's Pokedex.
    - The specific number of Pokemon available in each Generation is outlined in the Objectives section.

### Randomizing the Game
Once the Catch Order has been determined, the game must be randomized with some settings being required for this challenge.

The randomizer of choice is the Universal Pokemon Randomizer ZX by Ajarmar, found here: https://github.com/Ajarmar/universal-pokemon-randomizer-zx/releases
If you are using a SpeedChoice ROMhack, please utilize the randomizer distributed with the SpeedChoice Emerald patch here: https://github.com/ProjectRevoTPP/pokeemerald-speedchoice/releases/tag/release

#### Required Randomizer Settings
- The three starting pokemon must be set to the first three pokemon in the Catch Order.  Configure the starters from left to right to ensure your Rival chooses the correct starter.
- Static Pokemon must be set to "Random (completely)".
- In-Game Trades must be set to "Randomize both Requested & Given Pokemon".
- Wild Pokemon must be set to "Area 1-to-1 Mapping", with the Additional Rule set to "Catch Em All Mode".
